Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

First step: Write a command intepreter to manage the AirBnB objects.
	This command intepreter helps to create a new object,
	Retrieve an object from a database,
	Do operations on objects (cout, compute stats, etc...)
	Update attributes of an object
	Destroy an object
